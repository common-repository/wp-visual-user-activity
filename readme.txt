Visually display the user activity in a time period. It answers the question: "How many users made 1, 2 and 3 comments in a time period?

== Description ==

The vision for this plug-in is to have a configurable set of visual user activity plots.

At the moment it plots 2 pies charts with the user activity in a selected period of time:

1. Comment activity in period (how many comments users left): how many users made 1 comment, how many users made 2 comments, how many users made 3 comments, etc.
1. New commenters in period (percentage of new users against users that commented before the start date)

Please offer any other chart suggestions and I'm glad to attempt to produce them for you.

Configuration options? At the moment you can select the start date, end date and the limit for number of comments.
